# Kids Allowance Book
(WIP)
## Purpose of this hobby project
_As a parent of kids, it's been getting harder to keep an eye on, or to control their monthly allowance savings while cash is less and less common in Sweden. It is a little bit too much to give them a real credit card, or money transfering system like Swish. Instead, I just needed a small application that could help me to see how much money they have spent and therefore how much left, etc. It is just like a small biggy bank in digital._

_I try to make this app kids friendly and also give it a mobile-app-like feeling._

_I build this app also for a sake of my learning. :)_
